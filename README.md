## ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m Yves Ngenzi

#### I program in Java using spring boot,javasript using node js, react js/next js, and react native. I am passionate about back-end and front-end application development. I also use Python with TensorFlow and Sklearn to write and test machine learning models. I am eager to learn as much as I can every single day. I post most of what I am learning here, and I do contribute to sequelize, an  ORM javascript library, and I do plan to contribute to more projects as time allows it.
