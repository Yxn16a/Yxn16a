## ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m Yves Ngenzi

#### I have been coding for the past four years using c++ and Python. However, I did  later suitch to Java and Python. Java has been my favorite language of all  the time. Not only does it provide garbage collecting, But also it can be used on any operating system. I am interested in builing android apps and applications using Spring Boot.I am currently in a Java bootCamp and there is still a lot to learn but the sky is the limit. I am eager to learn as much as I can. I post most of what I am learning here and I plan to contribute to other projects as time allows it.
