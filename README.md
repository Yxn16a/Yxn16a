## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yves Ngenzi

I have been coding for the past four years. I started with c++ and I did love the language but when I started to learn about pointers and pointers' closing to avoid memory leaks, I wondered if there is any other language that one can use to avoid memory leaks. Hence, Java showed up and since then Java has been my favorite language of all  the time. Not only does it provide garbage collecting, But also it can be used on any operating system. I am interested to builing android apps and website. I am also interesed in building back end software using Java.I am currently in a Java bootCamp and there is still a lot to learn but the sky is the limit. I am eager to learn as much as I can. I post most of what I am learning here and I plan to contribute to other projects as time allows it.
